This is an extremely stupid/dangerous game where you try to guess a random number.

The range is 1-100, and if you guess wrong, then your system will crash (if you are running the game on linux)

The command that crashes it is 'sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root /'.

This command basically causes irreversible data loss and will probably render your system unbootable.

This game is purely a joke and should only be run in a linux vm due to the risk of crashing your system.

Obviously, this game is not intended to run on bare metal systems.
